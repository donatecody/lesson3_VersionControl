            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a way to record changes to files or sets of files allowing you to keep backups of old versions, keep track of changes, be able to go back to previous versions, etc. Essentially, you're keeping track of the history of your project and making sure you can retrace your steps if necessary. Some software, like Photoshop, has built-in tools for this. For small-scale projects on an individual, private basis, you may have tried keeping track on your own by saving the files each time with filenames indicating the versions, revisions, etc. - like with your resume. However, as soon as you start working with a larger amount of files and collaborating with team members, this becomes a nightmare and there's a lot of room for error, especially if you want to work on the same files at the same time.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems (VCS) were designed to make it easier to keep track of files for bigger and collaborative projects. They allow you to keep copies of all versions of your files, go back to previous versions, keep backups, work on the same files with team members simultaneously and then merge your changes, keep track of who made which changes, and more benefits. Different types of Version Control Systems include Local - which is based on your local device, Centralized - which is based on a single central server from which clients can check out files, and Distributed - which keeps a copy of the full repository on each client's local device.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Distributed Version Control System. The benefit is that if any server dies, each client has a backup of the full repository. Since a full copy is on your local device, it's also very fast, because all the files are at your fingertips, rather than needing to be retrieved from a central server each time. Git can handle both small and very large projects and is used by some of the biggest names in the industry like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter. Unlike other Version Control Systems that store data as changes to base versions of each file over time, Git stores data as a stream of snapshots. Every time your file changes, Git stores a snapshot of the current file to refer to.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The remote repository is kept on a remote server and can be shared by multiple team members. The local repository resides on your local device and can be acquired by creating a new one or cloning an existing remote repository. On your local machine with Git you have can work with three states and directories. Modify files in your working directory, stage files to your staging area, and commit files to your local repository or Git directory. From there you can push them to the remote repository. The benefit is that you can keep works in progress in your working directory that you are not ready to commit to the repository yet.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three main Git commands you'll need are add, commit, and push. You can ADD from your working directory to your staging area and from there you can COMMIT to your local repository and then PUSH to the remote repository. Some other important Git commands are git init to create the initial repository, git status for a current report on the files in the working directory and staging areas, git config for setting configuration values like your username and email, and git pull, which fetches files from the remote repository to merge with  your local device. These are just a few examples.</p>
